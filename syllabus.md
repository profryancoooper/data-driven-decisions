**Course Description**: This course explores the integration of Monte Carlo
analysis—a powerful probabilistic modeling technique—with technical
communication. Students will learn how to effectively communicate results from
Monte Carlo methods for both technical and non-technical audiences. Topics
covered include probability modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, statistical
analysis, and the creation of technical reports and presentations.

## Course Goal:

Appreciate the intersection of quantitative engineering and
social design. As engineers, we are humans designing for other humans.
The questions we ignore are often more detrimental than the questions we
ask. Our goal is to discuss how engineering design affects people,
communities, and history. 

## Course Outcomes:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Criticize and edit generative AI outcomes**
    - Identify and revise passive voice constructions in technical writing 
    - Improve technical documents for conciseness by eliminating unnecessary words and redundancies
    - Proof read work to identify and improve technical communications
    - Quantify generalizations made by generative AI claims
    - Quantify changes in a doument to attribute authorship and
      intellectual property
2. **Discuss Uncertainty in Design:**
    - Perform statistical analysis of simulation data to extract meaningful insights
    - Present clear and concise statistical findings 
    - Distinguish between qualitative (social) and quantitative
      (engineering) uncertainty in technical documents
    - Illustrate the importance of social uncertainty in engineering
      design
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
    - Create Monte Carlo simulations using software tools (e.g., Python, R) to analyze complex systems and scenarios
    - Interpret and communicate the results of Monte Carlo simulations
    - Explain the principles and applications of Monte Carlo simulation in data-driven decision-making
    - Develop probabilistic models for real-world scenarios
4. **Create Visualizations of Data:**
    - Generate effective and informative visual representations of engineering data using appropriate tools (e.g., Excel, Python, or MATLAB)
    - Select suitable visualizations  for different data sets and e.g. plots, bar charts, scatter
     plots, histograms, contour plots,
     communication purposes
5. **Research Engineering Designs and Processes**
    - Find, review, and cite reliable sources of information (textbooks,
      articles, journals, news sources) 
    - Contextualize technical and social information to validate a design or process
    - Compose a unique case study in engineering decisions using data
      from models and sources
6. **Compose Writing According to Audiences:**
    - Identify and analyze the needs and expectations of different audiences 
    - Edit technical writing to communicate with audiences
   
## Course Information
__Course Title:__ ME3256 - Data Driven Decisions: Monte Carlo Analysis for Technical Communications

__Format:__ Online

__Instructor__: Prof. Ryan C. Cooper __<ryan.c.cooper@uconn.edu>__

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of probability and statistics is
recommended. Familiarity with programming languages such as Python or R is
beneficial but not required. I will provide example code and resources.
We are coding to learn, not learning to code.

__Office Hours/Availability:__ by appointment
<https://cooperrc.github.io>

__Preferred Contact:__ Post questions and comments to
[Discussions](https://github.com/cooperrc/data-driven-decisions/discussions)

## Assessment Methods:
1. **Writing Assignments:** Write 500-word technical documents 
2. **Technical Report:** Present a Monte Carlo solution to an
   engineering design problem in a 3000-word technical report
4. **Peer Review and Feedback:** Evaluate peers' technical communication, specifically revisions on the main technical report project
5. **Online Activities and Discussions:** Actively participate in online
   activities and revisions

## Grading Policy:
- Written Assignments: 30%
- Technical Report: 30%
- Online Activities and Participation: 20%
- Peer Review: 20%

**Note on Writing assignments:** Each written assignment will ask you to
explain a technical result to a given audience. You will get comments on the
assignment and a current grade. You can increase your grade by addressing the
comments and resubmitting the work.

**Note on Technical Report:** The project is a longer technical document for other
entry-level engineers. You will outline the report and share your
proposed figures and images and communicate your findings throughout
the course. You should plan to give and receive feedback on each stage of the writing process: 
- outline
- first draft
- final draft

## Academic Integrity: 
- The instructors encourage you to use a wide variety of resources
  including peers, online research, instructors, textbooks, articles,
  and even generative AI. **Be sure you properly cite your sources and
  explain your own intellectual contributions.** You should not let
  resources substitute any of our course learning objectives. 
- Read and understand [The UConn Student Code of Conduct](http://www.community.uconn.edu/student_code.html "The Student Code for Academic
  Integrity"). Students will follow all University regulations concerning the final exam.
