# HW_00 - Generative AI writing analysis

In this assignment, you will generate instructions on brushing your teeth. You can use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

Some metrics to add to the generated instructions:

- number of strokes per minute
- total brushing time
- time spent per tooth 
- number of teeth or total area to brush on teeth
- deflection of brush bristles for proper cleaning
- what else can you think of?

## Prompt Input and Output
**ME**

I need you to act as a father of two boys 5 and 8 years old. You are going to give them five steps to brush teeth. Make sure the total brushing time is 2 minutes

**ChatGPT**

Absolutely, let's simplify it into five steps to make sure we hit that 2-minute mark:

1. Wet your toothbrush and put a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on it.

2. Brush the front teeth (top and bottom) in small circles for 30 seconds.

3. Brush the back teeth (top and bottom) in small circles for another 30 seconds.

4. Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth for 15 seconds each. 

5. Finally, rinse your mouth and toothbrush. 

And there you have it! Five easy steps to keep those smiles bright and healthy. Let's make sure we do this both in the morning and before bed, okay?

## Revised document

1. Wet your toothbrush and put a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the bristles of the toothbrush. Toothpaste costs \$5 per container. Make sure to use less than 5 cents per brushing. 

> Can you add a weight to the "pea-sized amount?"

2. Brush the upper left, upper right, and upper front teeth inner and outer surfaces for 20 seconds each. Make sure the brush is never more than half-way smooshed against teeth. 

3. Brush the lower left, lower right, and lower front teeth inner and outer surfaces for 20 seconds each. Make sure the brush is never more than half-way smooshed against teeth. 

4. Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth for 10 seconds each. 

5. Rinse your mouth. Rinse the toothbrush with water three times.

## Document analysis

- Make a list of all the improvements and changes you made to document
- use the `tf_idf.cosineSimilarity` function to compare the AI version to your own

Write a report on your intellectual property  in the 'revised document'. 
- How much can you claim as yours?
- How many ideas came from AI?
- How many ideas came from you?
- Is this a _new_ document?
- If this work was made by you and another person-not AI-would you need to credit this person as a coauthor?
- What else can you discuss about this comparison and this process?

Cosine Similarity score was 43.1% so I think the document is mine with the included edits. The text is measureably different from the original ChatGPT output. In each step, I added my own expertise and background to make the instructions more clear and precise. Therefore, I added 5 ideas to the document.
